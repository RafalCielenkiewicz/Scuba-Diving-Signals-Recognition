# Scuba-Diving-Signals-Recognition
This project aims to develop a system capable of recognizing scuba diving hand signals in real time. The system consists of two main components. Hand Detection ,utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect hands in video frames and Gesture Classification, employs a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify detected gestures.
